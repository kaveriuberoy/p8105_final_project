## Motivation:

The spread of Covid-19 across the United States reveals how factors such
as weather, population density, and socioeconomic conditions can
influence health outcomes. This project focuses on mapping Covid-19
cases at the county level to better understand these relationships. By
integrating data from The New York Times on county-level Covid-19 cases
with weather, population, and socioeconomic information, we aim to
identify patterns that may have influenced the spread of the virus.
Overall, by studying these relationships we will be able to gain insight
into how public health outcomes are shaped by broader ecological and
social systems.

## Intended Product :

The goal of this project is to produce a comprehensive, county-level
analysis of how COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates vary
across the United States in relation to population density,
socioeconomic, health, and environmental factors. The final products
will include interactive visualizations (maps and dashboards),
statistical summaries, and predictive models exploring correlations
between pandemic outcomes and variables such as income, education,
obesity, mobility, air quality, and weather.

## Our anticipated data sources:

Datasets: [socioeconomic
data](https://github.com/evangambit/JsonOfCounties), COVID-19 data
(2020,2021,2022,2023, recent). These datasets draw from reputable
government and research institutions, as described on each
page.Together, joined by county, these sources will enable a detailed,
multidimensional view of the socioeconomic and environmental factors
correlated with the COVID-19 outcomes across U.S. counties.

## Planned Analysis:

1.  Clean, merge, and standardize county-level datasets; calculate
    cumulative COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates; examine temporal
    trends across U.S. regions.
2.  Model relationships between COVID-19 outcomes and county
    characteristics, including environmental factors and demographic
    variables.

## Planned Visuals: \`

An interactive U.S. map displaying case and death rates alongside
socioeconomic and environmental factors, time-series plots of cases by
region, and scatterplots illustrating relationships between COVID-19
outcomes and key county-level factors.

## Anticipated Challenges

Harmonizing datasets, creating mapped visuals, dealing with co-linearity
between factors, managing time lag in correlation with covid incidence.

## Planned Timeline:

Nov 6: Decide datasets, finish the initial proposal. Nov 10-14: Zoom
meeting to discuss splitting up tasks. Start cleaning, merging, and
tidying datasets. Nov 14-20: Finish cleaning data and start modeling
relationships and creating plots. Have another Zoom meeting to check
progress and divide sections for the final report. During Thanksgiving
week, Dec 1-4: Finalize visualizations, complete report, complete
webcast. Make sure everything is submitted by December 6th.
